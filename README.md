# ProceduralCityGenerator-100-hours

I worked as the leader of a 9 person team that procedurally generated cyberpunk cities. Our work was inspired by Peter Wonka's procedural building generation. Every building was generated using our python scripts. The large city layout was achieved by using Voronoi diagrams to place the buildings.

I was responsible for the art style and for generating the buildings that you can see below. A context aware grammar constructs buildings by stacking rectangular boxes. We spent a total of two and a half weeks on this project.
